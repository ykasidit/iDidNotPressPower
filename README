About
-----------
iDidNotPressPower is used to shutdown the notebook computer within 60 seconds in case it was accidentally powered-on by a drop or shock - if user doesn't press Cancel.

The original version was developed and deployed at http://www.clearevo.com/

The little program was made because the developer and his friends had sometimes experienced that their notebooks accidentally booted in their notebook-bag when it was hit or dropped, then the notebook became VERY dangerously hot as it powered and stayed on in a closed bag without air flow - so this little app was coded to make sure the user actually booted the notebook intentionally - and presses Cancel - otherwise it would shutdown the notebook in 60 Seconds.

Compiling
-----------
This project was developed and built via "Qt Eclipse Integration for C++" please see more info at:
http://qt.nokia.com/developer/eclipse-integration

Installing
----------

- Your notebook must be set to auto-login.

GNU/Linux:
1. Compile and put the binary in your home folder, allow it to execute: chmod +x iDidNotPressPower
2. Make a new file, rename it as autoshut.sh, chmod +x autoshut.sh. This app must be run as root (because "halt" needs root), edit your sh to contain something like:

echo "mypassword" | sudo -S /home/<your user>/iDidNotPressPower

3.  Add to computer startup, for example, in ubuntu "session and startup" add a new one and copy the autoshut.sh file in the file browser, paste it into "command", or enter something like:
/home/<your user>/autoshut.sh
