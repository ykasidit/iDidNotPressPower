About
-----------
iDidNotPressPower is used to shutdown the notebook computer within 60 seconds in case it was accidentally powered-on by a drop or shock - it would cancel the countdown and exit if user moves the mouse cursor.

iDidNotPressPower is developed for both Ubuntu GNU/Linux and Windows.

The original version was developed and deployed at http://www.clearevo.com/
Source code is hosted at http://github.com/ykasidit/iDidNotPressPower/

The little program was made because the developer and his friends had sometimes experienced that their notebooks accidentally booted in their notebook-bag when it was hit or dropped, then the notebook became VERY dangerously hot as it powered and stayed on in a closed bag without air flow - so this little app was coded to make sure the user actually booted the notebook intentionally - and moves the mouse - otherwise it would shutdown the notebook in 60 Seconds.


THIS PROGRAM USES QT 4.5 (LGPL) DYNAMICALLY LINKED
--------------------------------------------------
You can get qt source code and its licenses from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads


Compiling
-----------
This project was developed and built via "Qt Eclipse Integration for C++" please see more info at:
http://qt.nokia.com/developer/eclipse-integration

To make a release build, right click project > properties > C/C++ make project > Make Builder tab > Build: release (default would be "debug")  

Installing
----------

- Your notebook must be set to auto-login.

GNU/Linux:
1. Get and install Qt 4.5, compile it. 
OR
1. Use the (Ubuntu) compiled binary, make sure you have libqtcore4 and libqtgui4 installed (run in terminal: sudo apt-get install libqtcore4 libqtgui4).
2. Allow it to execute: chmod +x iDidNotPressPower, test running it: ./iDidNotPressPower
3. Make a new file, rename it as autoshut.sh, chmod +x autoshut.sh. This app must be run as root (because "halt" needs 
root), edit your sh to contain something like:

echo "mypassword" | sudo -S /home/<your user>/<folder>/iDidNotPressPower

4.  Add to computer startup, for example, in ubuntu "session and startup" add a new one and copy the autoshut.sh file in the file browser, paste it into "command" so you'll get the file path (remove file:// if present), or enter something like:
/home/<your user>/<folder>/autoshut.sh

Windows:
1. Get and install Qt 4.5, compile it.
OR
1. Use the compiled binary windows release zip, the qt lib dlls should be included, try double-click the iDidNotPressPower.exe.
2. Create a shortcut to iDidNotPressPower.exe, put the shortcut in the "Startup" folder. (Go to Start > All Programs > right-click "Startup" then "Open" - if would be like "C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Start Menu\Programs\Startup")
